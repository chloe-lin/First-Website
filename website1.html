<h1>Chloe Lin</h1>

<p>I'm a 14 year old student at Lord Byng. Contrary to popular belief, I am not in the Byng Arts program. I play violin and viola, but I prefer viola, even though I've been playing violin for longer. I have two siblings: my sister, Claire, who is twelve years older than me, and my brother, Brian, who is two years is younger than me.</p>
<p>I was born in Canada and raised here as well. I can speak some Cantonese and Mandarin, but I'm not very good at it. I went to Laurier Annex in kindergarten to grade two and then to Quilchena Elementary from grade three to seven. I'm almost constantly reading, and I go through books fairly quickly.</p>
